# UABC
> uabc: Ultimate Algorithm Battle - Client

This is a websocket client that allows participation in Socialgorithm Tournaments. Learn more about those in our [documentation](https://socialgorithm.org/docs/)

This client will executes your player file, and pipe the stdin/stout generated by that process to the tournament server over a socket.

This means that your player can be written in any language, and it will work as long as your computer can run it.

## Getting started

> Note: If you are participating in a competition, it is best to start in the [Participant section of the documentation](https://socialgorithm.org/docs/sections/workshop/participate/participate.html).

Install the executable:

```bash
$ npm install -g @socialgorithm/uabc
```
Verify the installation by running:

```bash
$ uabc --version
```

## Options

Run `uabc -h` to see the full list of options:

## Running the sample player

You will need to clone the specific sample player that you want to run, for example, for tic-tac-toe:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:socialgorithm/tic-tac-toe-player
$ cd tic-tac-toe-player
```

Then run the sample using the globally installed UABC, for example:

```bash
$ uabc --host "https://sg-tournament.herokuapp.com" 
  --lobby "{YOUR_LOBBY_NAME}" 
  --token "Player1" 
  -f "node run_player.js random"
```
